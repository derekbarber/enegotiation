    %p Smartsettle is an automated eNegotiation system. Your privacy is important to Smartsettle. By using the Smartsettle website or the the Smartsettle software, you consent to the practices described by this Privacy Policy. Each time you use this website, the current version of this Privacy Policy will govern your use. Accordingly, each time you use this website, you should check the date at the bottom of this page to be sure that you’ve read the most recent version.

    %p We limit the collection and use of customer information to the minimum required to deliver superior service to our customers, which includes advising them about our products, services and other opportunities, and to administer our business. We do not reveal customer information to external organizations unless we have previously informed the customer in disclosures or agreements, have been authorized by the customer, or are required by law.

    %p We permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, to have access to that information. Employees who violate our Privacy Policy are subject to an effective disciplinary process.

    %p If a facilitator is involved in the negotiation, privacy of the information to which the facilitator is given access, is governed by a separate agreement signed prior to beginning the process. The recommended form to be used by Smartsettle facilitators is available upon request.

    %p As part of using Smartsettle’s services, there may be online communications between you and the party with whom you are negotiating.  These online communications are not reviewed by Smartsettle or any of its employees, agents or representatives, and this information is not retained by Smartsettle outside of your case.  It is your choice to disclose information to the other party. Private information entered into the system during negotiation is always under the control of the user and is accessible only by those to whom the user gives the access codes. Users can change or remove their private party information at any time. Except as otherwise decided by the negotiating parties, all decisions reached with Smartsettle will be kept confidential.

    %p Please contact us if you have any comments or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy.
