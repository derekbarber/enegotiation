    			<td>This year's Smartsettle One Competition was a great opportunity for anyone in the ADR or Mediation areas of law to gain a glimpse into the endless possibilities of Smartsettle. The way in which this program has been set up will be valuable for mediators, arbitrators, and participants alike. Smartsettle has proven to be a powerful, efficient, and reliable way to settle complex litigations, small claims, or multi-party cases. Smartsettle maximizes each participant's time, energy, and money in settlement situations. I especially thought that the hidden acceptance and visibile acceptance was a great way of going about the mediation; parties walk away with an agreement resulting from a zero-pressure, comfortable environment.</td>
